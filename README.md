# Watchpedia
This is a website that displays trending movies and TV shows, and provides a large database of information about these titles. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes APIs to gather data about movies and TV shows.

## How It&#39;s Made:

**Tech used:**  JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, Tailwind and WatchMode API

The website was built using HTML and CSS to create the user interface and JavaScript to handle user interaction and API requests. The website utilizes two APIs to gather data about movies and TV shows: The Movie Database API and the WatchMode API. The website displays trending movies and TV shows on the home page, with links to view more information about each title. When a user clicks on a title, the JavaScript code sends an API request to the corresponding API to gather more information about the title, such as plot summary, cast and crew, and ratings. The website then displays this information to the user.
## Optimizations

To optimize the website, I implemented a search feature that allows users to search for specific movies and TV shows. The search feature sends an API request to both the Movie Database and TV WatchMode APIs, and displays the search results to the user.

## Lessons Learned:

Through building this website, I gained experience in working with APIs and retrieving data from external sources. I also learned about the importance of handling API errors and displaying error messages to the user. Additionally, I gained experience in structuring JavaScript code for a complex application and handling user input.
